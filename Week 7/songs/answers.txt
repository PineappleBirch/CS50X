I would calculate the mean of all the song's danceability, energy, and valence.

This might not be the appropriate approach because it only expresses 1 numeric value (instead of 2 categorical values - moods)
and also it's not sophisticated enough to actually calculate the TOP 2 moods.

We could collect MUCH more data about the songs, run it through algorithms (probably DL Models) that assign "mood" values to each of the TOP 100 songs,
or assign it manually through our own judgement.

Then I'd use an equivalent of Pandas' "value_counts" DF method to get the counts of each categorical variable (mood).

Then I'd sort it in order and filter for the 2 most commonly appearing moods.

And voil√†, there it is! The 2 most common "moods" of their songs they listened to the most in 2018. We could use these to create a recommendation lists:
Recommend to the user those songs that match these 2 moods.
